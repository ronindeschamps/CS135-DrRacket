;; In this lab you will write code in steps that generates the power set of a given A.
;; You will need to specify #lang racket as the first line of your file.

;; First we need to be able to convert a given non-negative integer into a list of
;; its digits in the binary representation. This can be accomplished in two ways:
;;
;; Method 1:
;;
;; 1) convert a positive integer to binary string (use the number->string function with the base of 2)
;; 2) convert string to a list of characters (use the string->list function )
;; 3) use the map function to convert each character in the list into a single digit string (e.g., (string #\1) -> "1" )
;; 4) use the map function to convert a single digit string into a number (use the string->number function)
;;
;; Method 2:
;; Recursively perform the following operations:
;; 1) find the remainder mod 2 <- this will be your next digit from the end
;; 2) subtract the remainder from the original number and then divide by 2
;; 3) go to step 1)
;;
;; It is up to you which method you choose.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (cvt-to-list 0) -> '(0)
;; (cvt-to-list 1) -> '(1)
;; (cvt-to-list 2) -> '(1 0)
;; (cvt-to-list 3) -> '(1 1)
;; (cvt-to-list 4) -> '(1 0 0)
;; (cvt-to-list 7) -> '(1 1 1)
;;
;; num is assumed to be a non-negative integer.
(define (cvt-to-list num)
  (if (= num 0)
      '(0)
      (cvt-to-listh num)))
      
(define (cvt-to-listh num)
  (if (= num 0)
      '()
    (append (cvt-to-listh(quotient num 2))(list(remainder num 2)))))

;;
;; pad-to-length is a function which takes as arguments
;; a list of digits and a number n. It prepends the list of digits
;; with 0s until the digit list has the length n. If the list's length is
;; >= than n, then pad-to-length does not alter the digit list.
;;
;; (pad-to-length '(1 0 1) 7) -> '(0 0 0 0 1 0 1)
;; (pad-to-length '(1 0 1) 2) -> '(1 0 1)
;;  (pad-to-length '() 10)    -> '(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)

(define (pad-to-length digits n)
  (cond ((>= (length digits) n) digits)
        (else (pad-to-length (append '(0) digits) n))))



;; cvt-to-list-padded should work in the same way as cvt-to-list except that it
;; padds 0s to the left of the list if the list returned previously from cvt-to-list has
;; length smaller than the argument's length.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (cvt-to-list-padded 10 7) -> '(0 0 0 1 0 1 0)
;; (cvt-to-list-padded 10 15) -> '(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0)
;; (cvt-to-list-padded 7 2) -> '(1 1 1) ; When the length asked for is shorter than the digit list, we ignore the second argument

(define (cvt-to-list-padded num length)
  (define x (cvt-to-list num))
  (pad-to-length x length)
  )


;; pick-subset is the core function of this lab. Given a list A (interpreted as a set of some distinct elements)
;; and a bit list, one picks up elements of the set A that correspond to 1s in the bit list provided
;; as the second argument. As a result, one obtains a subset of the set A. If the bit list is shorter
;; than the set, the bit-list  is assumed to contain the suitable number of 0s at its end.  For simplicity
;; we'll assume that the bit-list will never be longer than A.
;;
;; Examples:
;; (pick-subset '(a b c d) '(1 0 1 0)) -> '(a c)
;; (pick-subset '(a b c d) '(0 1 1 1)) -> '(b c d)
;; (pick-subset '(a b c d) '(0 1)) -> '(b)
;; (pick-subset '(a b c d) '(0 0 0 0)) -> '()

;; The elements of A are assumed to be distinct.

(define (pick-subset A bit-list)
  (if (or (equal? A '())(equal? bit-list '())) '()
  (if (equal? (car bit-list) 1)
      (append (list (car A)) (pick-subset (cdr A) (cdr bit-list)))
      (pick-subset (cdr A) (cdr bit-list)))))
 


;; The below function takes a set A (a list of distinct elements) and a non-negative number n.
;; It then counts from n down to 0 in binary generating subsets corresponding to digits of
;; n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0 in their binary representation.
;; For example, counting from 8 to 0 would geneerate bit lists
;;
;; 1 0 0 0
;; 0 1 1 1
;; 0 1 1 0
;; 0 1 0 1
;; 0 1 0 0
;; 0 0 1 1
;; 0 0 1 0
;; 0 0 0 1
;; 0 0 0 0 
;;
;; which would then be converted to subsets of the set A. If A was '(a b c d), we would obtain
;; (a)
;; '(b c d)
;; '(b c)
;; ...
;; ...
;; '(d)
;; '()
;;
;; Examples:
;;  (pick-subsets-down-from-num '(a b c d) 8) -> '((a) (b c d) (b c) (b d) (b) (c d) (c) (d) ())
;;  (pick-subsets-down-from-num '(a b c d) 4) -> '((b) (c d) (c) (d) ())
;;  (pick-subsets-down-from-num '(a b c ) 7) -> '((a b c) (a b) (a c) (a) (b c) (b) (c) ()) ; Note: those are all subsets of '(a b c)
;;
;;
(define (pick-subsets-down-from-num A n)
  (if (equal? 0 n)
      '('())
      (cons (pick-subset A (cvt-to-list-padded n (length A)))
            (pick-subsets-down-from-num A (- n 1))))) 


;; As explained in class, one can now generate all subsets of a set A by counting down from n = 2^l - 1 to 0 where
;; l is the length of the set A. That's what the function power-set should do. Generating all binary numbers in the
;; above range will enumereate all possible 0-1 sequences which then will be used to "pick up" all possible subsets.
;; Here, each number (a bit list for us) in the range will be padded with 0s so that it has l digits.
;; To implement power-set you simply need to run pick-subsets-down-from-num with the second argument 2^l - 1.
;;
;; (power-set '(a b c d)) -> '((a b c d) (a b c) (a b d) (a b) (a c d) (a c) (a d) (a) (b c d) (b c) (b d) (b) (c d) (c) (d) ())
;; (power-set '(1 2 3)) -> '((1 2 3) (1 2) (1 3) (1) (2 3) (2) (3) ())
